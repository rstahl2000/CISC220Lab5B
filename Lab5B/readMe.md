All our code for the search tree is in BSTY.cpp. LL.cpp and NodeL.cpp have the modified code for the linked list. When ran with the game uncommented, the console printout cuts out the first part, so the screenshots contain what is printed when game is commented out and what is printed when the game is ran. The folder Lab 5B Screenshots contains two folders, one that is the console screenshots for when game is uncommented and one for when game is commented out.
